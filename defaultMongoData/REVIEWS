At face value, it introduces the concepts of programming, running, and debugging embedded systems in environments that could theoretically be encountered in the real world. \n The reality of this course, however, is quite the opposite. ENCM 511 is bogged down by poor course direction, limited educational information, and lab work that is so insufferably unrealistic despite claims that it is akin to the \"real world\".\n The embedded curcuit board provided for the course comes with a lab manual that describes the board functionality fully and simply in a way that any student within the class should be capable of understanding. Despite this, the course instructor insists on providing students with a poorly designed \"abridged\" manual that completely removes the critical descriptions of each componenet. Instead the abridged manual only provides unlabelled diagrams which are completely useless.","_tags":"[\"Bad\", \"EndMe\", \"ThanksIHateIt\", \"BadTest\", \"Confusion\"]","_date_posted":"2020-04-01T03:26:58.901Z"}

Until you take the course. The instruction, although given by someone who likes the subject, has no substance to it at all. This is a shame since it could be interesting given the subject matter. The tests we had to write were about random facts he said under his breathe in class. This made it very difficult to create a study sheet. The problem is also that most of the information learned is so outdated that it isn't even applicable if you wanted to do nanofabrication. Most of the information he pulls from is his Ph.D. research and masters which he did in the '90s. Surprisingly since then, technology has changed quite a bit, but it seems he wasn't informed. Learning about the Intel museum by a slide show and pictures of plaques of information should not be in a course syllabus. This does not help my learning, and this does not help anyone's learning. This actually uses up brain space that I would rather use on something else, like how long it takes for mulberry purple paint to dry on a wall.","_tags":"[\"Bad\", \"EndMe\", \"ThanksIHateIt\", \"BadFinal\", \"Confusion\", \"BadLectures\"]","_date_posted":"2020-04-01T03:27:01.172Z"}
